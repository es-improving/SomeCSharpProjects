        <h2>Step 1: Basic Addition</h2>

        <p>In this first step, ask for two inputs and add those.</p>

        <h2>Step 2: Checking Your Inputs</h2>

        <p>If the user enters in something that isn't a valid number, return an error message instead of computing the value.</p>

        <h2>Step 3: Take in Math Equation</h2>

        <p>Instead of asking for two separate numbers, change it to take in a string like "5 + 7". Once you've grabbed the numbers, be sure validate them to make sure they're valid.</p>

        <p>The error path should look the same.</p>

        <div class="hint">
            <p>It's probably easiest to user <code>yourStringVariable.Split(" ")</code> to turn the whole input string into an array, then use array indexing to get the values. Since you know you are doing addition, you don't need the "+" sign quite yet.</p>
